  ## Statistical Analysis

### 1. Build in Datasets

```shell
tips
iris
penguins
flights
diamonds
titanic
exercise
mpg
planets
anagrams
anscombe
attention
brain_networks
car_crashes
dots
dowjones
fmri
geyser
glue
healthexp
seaice
taxis
```
### 2. Load the dataset

```py
import seaborn as sns

# Load the tips dataset
tips = sns.load_dataset('tips')
```


### 3. df.describe()
This method generates descriptive statistics that summarize the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of a dataset's distribution. It automatically provides statistics like count, mean, standard deviation, min, max, and quartiles for numerical columns, and counts, unique values, and top frequencies for non-numerical columns when include='all' is used.

```py
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd # pandas is implicitly used by seaborn's load_dataset

# Load the titanic dataset
df = sns.load_dataset('titanic')

# --- Start of df.describe() demonstration ---

# Use df.describe() to generate descriptive statistics of the DataFrame's numerical columns.
# By default, it computes count, mean, std, min, 25%, 50% (median), 75%, and max.
print("\n--- Descriptive Statistics of the Titanic dataset (df.describe()) ---")
print(df.describe())

# Optional: You can also include non-numerical (object or categorical) columns by specifying include='all'
print("\n--- Descriptive Statistics including all column types (df.describe(include='all')) ---")
print(df.describe(include='all'))

```

### 4. df.mean()
This calculates the arithmetic mean (average) of the values in each numerical column of the DataFrame. By default, it computes the mean for each column, but can also compute it across rows.

```py
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd # pandas is implicitly used by seaborn's load_dataset

# Load the titanic dataset
df = sns.load_dataset('titanic')

# --- Simple example of df.mean() ---

# Calculate the mean of all numeric columns in the DataFrame
# Non-numeric columns will be ignored automatically.
print("\nMean of numeric columns:")
print(df.mean(numeric_only=True))

```

### 5. df.corr()
This method computes the pairwise correlation of columns, excluding NA/null values. It measures the linear relationship between numerical variables, resulting in a correlation matrix.

```py
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd # pandas is implicitly used by seaborn's load_dataset

# Load the titanic dataset
df = sns.load_dataset('titanic')

# Calculate the correlation matrix
# df.corr() computes the pairwise correlation of columns,
# excluding non-numeric columns by default.
print("\nCorrelation Matrix of Numeric Columns:")
print(df.corr(numeric_only=True))

```

### 6. df.count()
This returns the number of non-NA/null observations for each column in the DataFrame. It's useful for quickly checking completeness of data per column.

```py
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd # pandas is implicitly used by seaborn's load_dataset

# Load the titanic dataset
df = sns.load_dataset('titanic')

# --- Using df.count() ---
print("\n--- df.count() Output ---")
# df.count() calculates the number of non-null values for each column.
# This is useful for quickly seeing how complete your data is across different features.
print(df.count())

```

### 7. df.max()
This calculates the maximum value for each numerical column in the DataFrame. It identifies the highest individual data point within each series.

```py
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd # pandas is implicitly used by seaborn's load_dataset

# Load the titanic dataset
df = sns.load_dataset('titanic')

print("\n--- Using df.max() ---")
# Get the maximum value for each column in the DataFrame.
# For numeric columns, it's the highest number.
print(df.max(numeric_only=True))

```

### 8. df.min()
This calculates the minimum value for each numerical column in the DataFrame. It identifies the lowest individual data point within each series.

```py
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd # pandas is implicitly used by seaborn's load_dataset

# Load the titanic dataset
df = sns.load_dataset('titanic')

print("\n--- Using df.min() ---")

# Calculate the minimum value for each applicable column in the DataFrame
# df.min() will return a Series where the index is the column name
# and the value is the minimum value found in that column.
# It typically works on numeric, boolean, and datetime columns.
min_values = df.min(numeric_only=True) # numeric_only=True is good practice to avoid errors on non-numeric types

print("Minimum values for each numeric column:")
print(min_values)

```

### 9. df.median()
This computes the median (50th percentile) of the values in each numerical column. The median is the middle value in a sorted list of numbers, making it less sensitive to outliers than the mean.

```py
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd # pandas is implicitly used by seaborn's load_dataset

# Load the titanic dataset
df = sns.load_dataset('titanic')

print("\n---")

# Calculate the median for all numeric columns in the DataFrame
# This will return a Series where the index is the column name and the value is its median.
print("\nMedian of numeric columns:")
print(df.median(numeric_only=True))

```

### 10. df.std()
This calculates the standard deviation of the values in each numerical column. It quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of data values around their mean.

```py
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd # pandas is implicitly used by seaborn's load_dataset

# Load the titanic dataset
df = sns.load_dataset('titanic')

# Calculate the standard deviation for all numerical columns in the DataFrame
print("\nStandard deviation of numerical columns:")
print(df.std(numeric_only=True))

```

### 11. df.var()
This computes the variance of the values in each numerical column. Variance is the average of the squared differences from the mean, providing another measure of data spread.

```py
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd # pandas is implicitly used by seaborn's load_dataset

# Load the titanic dataset
df = sns.load_dataset('titanic')

print("\n--- Variance of numerical columns ---")
# Calculate the variance for each numerical column in the DataFrame
# By default, .var() will compute variance for numerical columns.
# It skips non-numerical columns automatically.
print(df.var(numeric_only=True))

```

### 12. df.quantile(q)
This returns the value at the specified quantile(s) q for each numerical column in the DataFrame. Common quantiles include 0.25 (1st quartile), 0.5 (median), and 0.75 (3rd quartile).

```py
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd # pandas is implicitly used by seaborn's load_dataset

# Load the titanic dataset
df = sns.load_dataset('titanic')

print("\n--- Example of df.quantile(q) ---")

# Calculate the median (0.5 quantile) of the 'age' column
median_age = df['age'].quantile(0.5)
print(f"Median age of passengers: {median_age}")

# Calculate the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles (quartiles) of the 'fare' column
fare_quartiles = df['fare'].quantile([0.25, 0.5, 0.75])
print(f"\nFare quartiles (25th, 50th, 75th percentiles):\n{fare_quartiles}")

# Calculate the 90th percentile of 'age'
# This means 90% of the passengers are younger than or equal to this age
ninety_percentile_age = df['age'].quantile(0.90)
print(f"\n90th percentile of age: {ninety_percentile_age}")

```

### 13. df.skew()
This computes the skewness of the distribution for each numerical column. Skewness measures the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean.

```py
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd # pandas is implicitly used by seaborn's load_dataset

# Load the titanic dataset
df = sns.load_dataset('titanic')

print("\n--- Skewness of Numerical Columns (df.skew()) ---")
# Calculate the skewness of each numerical column in the DataFrame
# Skewness indicates the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean.
# A negative skew indicates the tail is on the left side of the distribution.
# A positive skew indicates the tail is on the right side.
print(df.skew(numeric_only=True))

```

### 14. df.kurt()
This computes the kurtosis of the distribution for each numerical column. Kurtosis measures the "tailedness" of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable, indicating how heavily the tails differ from the tails of a normal distribution.

```py
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd # pandas is implicitly used by seaborn's load_dataset

# Load the titanic dataset
df = sns.load_dataset('titanic')

print("\n--- Kurtosis of numerical columns ---")
# Calculate the kurtosis of all numerical columns in the DataFrame
# Kurtosis measures the "tailedness" of the distribution.
# A higher kurtosis value means more outliers or heavier tails.
# A lower kurtosis means fewer outliers or lighter tails.
print(df.kurt(numeric_only=True))

```

### 15. df.mode()
This returns the mode(s) of each column in the DataFrame, which is the value(s) that appear most frequently. A column can have multiple modes.

```py
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd # pandas is implicitly used by seaborn's load_dataset

# Load the titanic dataset
df = sns.load_dataset('titanic')

print("\n--- Mode of the DataFrame ---")
# Calculate the mode of each column.
# The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a column.
# Since a column can have multiple modes, it returns a DataFrame.
print(df.mode())

```
### 16. df.abs()
This calculates the absolute value of each element in the DataFrame. It transforms all negative numerical values into their positive counterparts.

```py
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd # pandas is implicitly used by seaborn's load_dataset

# Load the titanic dataset
df = sns.load_dataset('titanic')

# --- df.abs() Example ---

# To demonstrate .abs(), let's create a new column that contains negative values.
# For instance, we'll calculate a 'fare_deviation' from the average fare,
# which will naturally include negative values.
average_fare = df['fare'].mean()
df['fare_deviation'] = df['fare'] - average_fare

print("DataFrame with 'fare_deviation' (first 5 rows, before .abs()):")
print(df[['fare', 'fare_deviation']].head(5))
print("-" * 30)

# Apply .abs() to the 'fare_deviation' column
# This converts all negative values in the 'fare_deviation' column to their positive equivalents.
df['abs_fare_deviation'] = df['fare_deviation'].abs()

print("DataFrame with 'fare_deviation' and 'abs_fare_deviation' (first 5 rows, after .abs()):")
print(df[['fare', 'fare_deviation', 'abs_fare_deviation']].head(5))

```

### 17. df.prod()
This computes the product of the values in each numerical column. It multiplies all non-NA/null elements together.

```py
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd # pandas is implicitly used by seaborn's load_dataset

# Load the titanic dataset
df = sns.load_dataset('titanic')

# Create a small, simple DataFrame specifically to demonstrate df.prod()
# (The product of many numbers in Titanic's columns like 'fare' can be extremely large or 0)
small_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'A': [1, 2, 3],
    'B': [10, 20, 30],
    'C': [0.5, 1.0, 2.0]
})

print("\nSmall Sample DataFrame for df.prod() demonstration:")
print(small_df)
print("-" * 30)

# Example of df.prod()
# Calculate the product of all values in each column
product_result = small_df.prod()

print("\nResult of small_df.prod():")
print(product_result)
print("-" * 30)

# Example of Series.prod() on a single column
product_column_A = small_df['A'].prod()
print(f"\nProduct of values in column 'A': {product_column_A}")

```

### 18. df.cumsum()
This computes the cumulative sum of the values in each numerical column. It returns a DataFrame of the same size, where each element is the sum of all preceding elements in its column.

```py
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd # pandas is implicitly used by seaborn's load_dataset

# Load the titanic dataset
df = sns.load_dataset('titanic')

# Example of df.cumsum()
# We'll calculate the cumulative sum of the 'fare' column
# This shows the running total of fare for each passenger sequentially.
df['cumulative_fare'] = df['fare'].cumsum()

# Display the 'fare' and 'cumulative_fare' columns for the first few rows
print("DataFrame with 'cumulative_fare' column (first 10 rows):")
print(df[['fare', 'cumulative_fare']].head(10))

```

### 19. df.cumprod()
This computes the cumulative product of the values in each numerical column. It returns a DataFrame of the same size, where each element is the product of all preceding elements in its column.

```py
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd # pandas is implicitly used by seaborn's load_dataset

# Load the titanic dataset
df = sns.load_dataset('titanic')

# Example of df.cumprod() on the 'fare' column
# It calculates the cumulative product of elements along the column.
# Note: Cumulative products can grow very large very quickly!
print("\nCumulative product of 'fare' column:")
print(df['fare'].cumprod().head(5)) # Displaying only the first 5 cumulative products
print("-" * 30)

# Another example: Cumulative product on a smaller, cleaner numerical series
# Let's create a simpler series for clearer illustration of cumprod behavior
simple_series = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print("\nOriginal simple Series:")
print(simple_series)
print("-" * 30)

print("\nCumulative product of the simple Series:")
print(simple_series.cumprod())

```
### 20. df.pct_change()
This calculates the percentage change between the current and a prior element for each numerical column. It's commonly used in financial analysis to determine rate of return.

```py
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd # pandas is implicitly used by seaborn's load_dataset

# Load the titanic dataset
df = sns.load_dataset('titanic')

# --- Simple Example of df.pct_change() ---

# Let's look at the 'fare' column to see percentage change in fares
# The pct_change() method calculates the percentage change between the current and a prior element.
# The first value will be NaN (Not a Number) because there's no prior element to compare to.
df['fare_pct_change'] = df['fare'].pct_change()

print("\nDataFrame with 'fare_pct_change' column (first 5 rows):")
print(df[['fare', 'fare_pct_change']].head(5))

print("\nDataFrame with 'fare_pct_change' column (rows 20-25 for more non-NaN values):")
print(df[['fare', 'fare_pct_change']].iloc[20:25])

```

### 21. df.cov()
This computes the pairwise covariance of columns, excluding NA/null values. Covariance measures how two variables change together, indicating the direction of their linear relationship.

```py
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd # pandas is implicitly used by seaborn's load_dataset

# Load the titanic dataset
df = sns.load_dataset('titanic')

print("\n--- Covariance Matrix of Numerical Columns ---")
# Calculate the covariance matrix of the numerical columns in the DataFrame
# Covariance measures how two variables change together.
# A positive covariance indicates that variables tend to move in the same direction,
# while a negative covariance indicates they tend to move in opposite directions.
# A covariance of zero suggests no linear relationship.
print(df.cov(numeric_only=True))

```

### 22. df.sem()
This computes the standard error of the mean (SEM) for each numerical column. It estimates how much the sample mean is likely to vary from the population mean.

```py
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd # pandas is implicitly used by seaborn's load_dataset

# Load the titanic dataset
df = sns.load_dataset('titanic')

print("\n--- Applying df.sem() ---")

# Calculate the Standard Error of the Mean (SEM) for all numeric columns
# SEM is a measure of the statistical accuracy of an estimate, equal to the
# standard deviation of the population divided by the square root of the sample size.
# By default, it operates column-wise.
sem_values = df.sem(numeric_only=True)

print("\nStandard Error of the Mean (SEM) for numeric columns:")
print(sem_values)

# Example: SEM for a specific column, e.g., 'age'
sem_age = df['age'].sem()
print(f"\nSEM for 'age' column: {sem_age:.4f}")

```
